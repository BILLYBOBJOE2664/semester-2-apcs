			The game starts with a N by N grid of cells. Some of the cells contain mines while the others do not but you initially do no know which is which.
			You can left click on a cell to reveal it. If it is a mine, then you lose instantly, if it is not a mine, then it will reveal a number which will
			tell you the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells. If you right click a cell, you flag it as a mine which prevents you from revealing it
			and allows you to keep track of the position of known mines. You win if you reveal all the cells that are not mines. On the top you can see a value
			for "Mines Left" which is the number of mines minus the number of flags placed. You can also see "Time Left" which is how much time you have left.
